<h2>Welcome to the Meaningful Use Quality Measure Value Set Service</h2>

<div class="cts2-WelcomeText">

<p>The Value Set Viewer is a desktop application style web application that allows users to browse value sets and their members. This web application connects to a value set service providing the 2014 Clinical Quality Measures prescribed for Meaningful Use of Electronic Health Records. The Viewer's functionality is designed to allow users to access value sets without explicit knowledge of the standards that created them and to make unambiguous choices of a given value set. User selected value sets can be downloaded in a variety of formats.</p>

<p>Viewing and/or downloading value sets requires a free Unified Medical Language System&reg; Metathesaurus License, due to usage restrictions on some of the codes included in the value sets.  Authentication based on acceptance of the license agreement is required. A dialog window will pop up before allowing access to a service. Licensing and authentication credentials are available at the <a href="https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html" target="_blank">NLM UTS License Center</a>.</p>
